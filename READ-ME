LSP:

- JSE violations: Stack and Properties classes!
- Note how fixing the issue in the Client code RectangleServiceTest.doubleWidthOf violates the Open-Closed principle, we shouldn't have to change our client code when a new subclass is added!


Notice how by violating the "Tell, don't ask" principle we are also violating other principles:

- Law of Demeter (FinaliseOrderService)
- SRP (FinaliseOrderService)

Tell don't ask leads to cleaner code because:

- Responsibilities are better divided.
- Because responsibilities are better divided the business logic is more flexible when it comes to change.
(e.g.: What if the discount has to be applied to all orderLines? Or only to the one with the highest price?, etc.)
- Classes become easier to test.
    - FinaliseOrderServiceTest could for instance use a mock Order and simply verify that applyDiscount() is called.
    - OrderTest only tests that sorting is done correctly.
    - OrderLineTest only has to test the application of a discount on itself.
- Also notice how the Law Of Demeter is not violated anymore in FinaliseOrderServiceTest!
