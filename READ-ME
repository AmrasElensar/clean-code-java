LSP:

- JSE violations: Stack and Properties classes!
- Note how fixing the issue in the Client code RectangleServiceTest.doubleWidthOf violates the Open-Closed principle, we shouldn't have to change our client code when a new subclass is added!


Notice how by violating the "Tell, don't ask" principle we are also violating other principles:

- Law of Demeter (FinaliseOrderService)
- SRP (FinaliseOrderService)
